# Counter App with BLoC Pattern

This is a small project to demonstrate the use of the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern in a simple counter application. The app allows users to increment and decrement a counter using buttons and displays the current count on the screen.

# Introduction
The purpose of this project is to provide a basic example of how to implement the BLoC pattern to manage state and handle events in a Flutter application. The BLoC pattern is a popular state management approach that helps separate business logic from UI components, making the code more organized and maintainable.

# Features
-Increment the counter using the "+" button.

-Decrement the counter using the "-" button.

-Display the current count on the screen.

# Technologies Used
Flutter - A popular UI framework for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Dart - The programming language used to build Flutter applications.

# BLoC Architecture
The BLoC pattern consists of the following components:

Bloc: Represents the business logic component. It receives events, processes them, and emits new states. Event: Represents actions or events that can trigger state changes in the application. State: Represents the current state of the application. UI: The user interface that displays the state to the user and sends events to the BLoC. This project demonstrates a simple counter app, where the CounterBloc manages the state of the counter and responds to IncrementEvent and DecrementEvent events. The UI then listens to the state changes and updates the display accordingly.

# Feedback
We hope this project helps you understand how to use the BLoC pattern for state management in your Flutter applications. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to open an issue in the repository.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
